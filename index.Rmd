I work as a Data Scientist at Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust, a mental and general health Trust, working with both R and SQL on a daily basis. 

I'm a proud Senior Fellow of the [NHS-R Community](https://nhsrcommunity.com/) and NHS colleagues can use [Hexitime](https://hexitime.com/) time bank to exchange time and skills.

I have a particular interest in Ethics having studied Philosophy and some of my thoughts on this, along with technical blogs, can be found on my {distill} blog [site](https://lextuga007.github.io/PhilosopherAnalyst/).
